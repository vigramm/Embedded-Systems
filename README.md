We have tried to implement an IOT(Internet of things) device that provides crucial data as to when american football players have encountered a collision.

We have use accelerometer,LIS3DH and Esp8266.

# Requirements to implement this code

- Accelerometer LIS3DH
- [WiFi Module Esp8266](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-feather-huzzah-esp8266/overview)
- 

Boot.py is the first code that runs when esp8266 is connected to power
then our main code, main.py runs immediately after

it is here that we implement the detection of a collision

refer to datasheet of Lis3dh and esp8266 to understand the register allocation and i2c memory addresses used

#we need to write up more
