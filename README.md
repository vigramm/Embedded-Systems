This project is part of EEE department Embedded System coursework

We have tried to implement an IOT device that helps sports players involved in a lot of collision to detect these collisions

we have use accelerometer,LIS3DH and Esp8266

boot.py is the first code that runs when esp8266 is connected to power
then our main code, main.py runs immediately after

it is here that we implement the detection of a collision

refer to datasheet of Lis3dh and esp8266 to understand the register allocation and i2c memory addresses used

#we need to write up more
